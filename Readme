binary-shared (an addition for the binary package)
=========================================================
I had problems with the size of the allocated heap space after serializing 
and loading data with the binary package. The reason was that 
binary does not support sharing of identical elements, so I came up 
with the generic solution in this package.

This package is part of Leksah
